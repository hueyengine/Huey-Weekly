About Rachel Andrew

I’m a web developer and technical writer and editor. I work for Google on the Chrome team as a senior staff technical writer and content lead for web.dev and developer.chrome.com. I’m a member of the CSS Working Group of the W3C, and edit a couple of CSS specifications.

Prior to Google I spent 20 years as a freelancer and business owner. I founded edgeofmyseat.com in 2001 as a web development consultancy, the company moved into products launching Perch CMS in 2009 and Notist in 2018.

My professional web development skills range from front and back-end development to operations.
